Description
-----------

This module adds support for sending notifications via
[Gotify](https://gotify.net/). A queue is used to make sure
notifications are not lost on failure but sent later.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the module:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate mod/notification-gotify;

Also deploy the [Gotify server](https://github.com/gotify/server) and optionally install a Gotify client on your mobile device.

Configuration
-------------

Follow the [installation instructions](https://gotify.net/docs/install) and the [First Login setup](https://gotify.net/docs/first-login). Once you have a user and account you can start creating apps. Each app is an independent notification feed for a device or application.

![Create new app](notification-gotify.d/appsetup.avif)
 
On creation apps are assigned a Token for authentification and you can also assign a default priority for each app.

Edit `global-config-overlay`, add `GotifyServer` with your server address and `GotifyToken` with the token from your configured app on the Gotify server.
Then reload the configuration.

> ℹ️ **Info**: Copy relevant configuration from
> [`global-config`](../../global-config.rsc) (the one without `-overlay`) to
> your local `global-config-overlay` and modify it to your specific needs.

For a custom service installing an additional certificate may be required.
You may want to install that certificate manually, after finding the
[certificate name from browser](../../CERTIFICATES.md).

Usage and invocation
--------------------

There's nothing special to do. Every script or function sending a notification
will now send it to your Gotify application feed.

But of course you can use the function to send notifications directly. Give
it a try:

    $SendGotify "Subject..." "Body...";

Alternatively this sends a notification with all available and configured
methods:

    $SendNotification "Subject..." "Body...";

To use the functions in your own scripts you have to declare them first.
Place this before you call them:

    :global SendGotify;
    :global SendNotification;

In case there is a situation when the queue needs to be purged there is a
function available:

    $PurgeGotifyQueue;

Run scripts on ppp connection
=============================

[◀ Go back to main README](../README.md)

🛈 This script can not be used on its own but requires the base installation.
See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

This script is supposed to run on established ppp connection. Currently
it does:

* release IPv6 dhcp leases (and thus force a renew)
* run [update-tunnelbroker](update-tunnelbroker.md)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate ppp-on-up;

... and make it the `on-up` script for ppp profile:

    / ppp profile set on-up=ppp-on-up [ find ];
